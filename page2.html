<h2>Brief history about Diani.</h2>
Diani Beach is a major beach on the Indian Ocean coast of Kenya (in eastern Africa).It is located 30 kilometres (19 mi) south of Mombasa, in Kwale County.
It has been voted Africa's leading beach destination for the fifth time running since 2015.
The beach is about 17 kilometres (11 mi) long, from the Kongo river to the north and Galu beach to the south (the southern point of reference is an old Baobab tree). Diani is one of the most prominent tourism resort areas of Kenya. The indigenous people of the area are the Digo, one of the nine ethnic communities known as the Mijikenda. Today the area includes Kenyans of various ethnicities who have migrated to Diani, drawn by the tourism related economy.With a population of over 100,000 inhabitants, the Diani/Ukunda urban area is one of the largest at the Kenyan coast and forms part of the larger Mombasa metropolitan region. A small airstrip - Ukunda Airport - is located between the beach area and the Mombasa-Lunga Lunga road. The water remains shallow near shore, with some underwater sandbars near the surface which allow wading with a clear view of the sandy bottom. Inland from the beach, there is extensive vegetation (see photo at right), including numerous palm trees which cover the coastal areas, unlike the dry acacia trees of the mountainous Kenyan Highlands. The Mwachema River flows into the sea at Diani Beach.
The general area is known for its coral reefs, black-and-white colobus monkeys, and for the closely located Shimba Hills National Reserve, a wildlife reserve which looks out over the Indian Ocean. Diani Beach has restaurants, hotels, supermarkets, and several shopping centres.
Diani Beach is also a popular kitesurfing, jet skiing, and snorkelling location.
The 16th century Kongo Mosque is located at the Northern tip of Diani Beach, where the Kongo river flows into the ocean separating Diani beach from Tiwi. It is the last remaining ancient Swahili structure in Diani.

      The Great Pyramid of Giza is a defining symbol of Egypt
       and the last of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World. It is located on the
        Giza plateau near the modern city of Cairo and was built over a twenty-year period during the 
      reign of the king Khufu (2589-2566 BCE, also known as Cheops) of the 4th Dynasty.
      The pyramid rises to a height of 479 feet (146 metres) with a base of 754 feet
       (230 metres) and is comprised of over two million blocks of stone. Some of these stones 
       are of such immense size and weight (such as the granite slabs in the King's Chamber) that the logistics of
       raising and positioning them so precisely seems an impossibility by modern standards.

  <br>
  <li><b style="color: cyan;">Victoria Falls, Zambia and Zimbabwe</b></li>
  <p6>This falls are not only the largest waterfalls in the world but they are also the highest free standing 
    waterfall in the world.
    Victoria Falls is situated at the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, about 20 miles from the Mozambican town.
    
    This falls are not only beautiful but they are also very dangerous for tourists.
      They can be deadly if you don't take care of your self.Therefore we should avoid visiting there at night or when its.
      There have been many deaths due to falling into the river or even drowning.
      So its best to be careful while visiting Victoria Falls.
      <br>
      This falls are surrounded by lush greenery which makes you feel like you are in paradise.
      But unfortunately there is a lot of pollution around the falls.So please take care of your environment.

<p7> <li><b style="color: cyan;">Mount Kilimanjaro,Tanzania</b></li>
  Located in Tanzania, Mount Kilimanjaro is Africa’s tallest mountain at about 5,895 meters (19,340 feet).
   It is the largest free-standing mountain rise in the world, meaning it is not part of a mountain range.

Also called a stratovolcano (a term for a very large volcano made of ash, lava, and rock), 
Kilimanjaro is made up of three cones: Kibo, Mawenzi, and Shira. Kibo is the summit of the mountain and the tallest of the three volcanic formations. While Mawenzi and Shira are extinct, Kibo is dormant and could possibly erupt again. Scientists estimate that the last time it erupted was 360,000 years ago. The highest point on Kibo’s crater rim is called Uhuru, the Swahili word for “freedom.” The mountain is also known for its snow-capped peak; however, scientists warn that the snow might disappear within the next 20 years or so.

In 1889, German geographer Hans Meyer and Austrian mountaineer
 Ludwig Purtscheller became the first people on record to reach the summit of Kilimanjaro. Since then, Kilimanjaro has become a popular hiking spot for locals and tourists. Because mountaineering gear and experience is not needed to reach the peak, tens of thousands of climbers ascend the mountain each year. The climb is still dangerous, however, because of the risk of altitude sickness—a condition climbers experience if they ascend too quickly, which can be deadly if not treated right away.

In 1973, the mountain and its six surrounding 
forest corridors were named Kilimanjaro National Park in order to protect 
its unique environment. The park was named a United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural 
Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage site in 1987. A variety of animals live in the area surrounding the 
mountain, including the blue monkey.

<p8><h2>To the World Now !!</h2>
  Here we will see about 5 nicest place you and I will wish to Visit across our life time.Haha!
  <br>
  <li><b style="color: cyan;">The Effiel Tower,France</b></li>
  The Eiffel Tower is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, 
  France. It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, 
  whose company designed and built the tower from 1887 to 1889.

  Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" (French for "Iron Lady"), it was
   constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair, and to crown
    the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution. Although initially 
    criticised by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its 
    design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France and one of the
     most recognisable structures in the world.The tower received 5,889,000 
     visitors in 2022.The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an 
     entrance fee in the world:
  6.91 million people ascended it in 2015. It was designated a monument historique in 1964,
   and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991.
   The tower is 330 metres (1,083 ft) tall,[8] about the same height as an 81-storey building, 
  and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square, measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each 
  side. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the
   tallest human-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building 
   in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure in the world to surpass both the
    200-metre and 300-metre mark in height. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the top of
    the tower in 1957, it is now taller
     than the Chrysler Building by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding 
     transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest free-standing structure in 
     France after the Millau Viaduct.
  
  The tower has three levels for visitors, with restaurants on 
  the first and second levels. The top level's upper platform is 
  276 m (906 ft) above the ground the highest observation deck 
  accessible to the public in the European Union. Tickets can be 
  purchased to ascend by stairs or lift to the first and second levels.
   The climb from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as 
   is the climb from the first level to the second, making the entire ascent
    a 600 step climb. Although there is a staircase to the top level, it is
     usually accessible only by lift. On this top, third level is a private 
     apartment built for Gustave Eiffel's private use. He decorated it with 
     furniture by Jean Lachaise and invited friends such as Thomas Edison.

  <li><b style="color: cyan;">Santorini,Greece</b></li>
  The everlasting beauty of Santorini Greece attracts thousands of visitors every year. Hence, it is no wonder 
  that the island is one of the top tourist destinations in the world. Its wild 
  volcanic landscape, rugged cliffs, wild nature, and beautiful shores, combined 
  with its rich history and traditions, make the island the gem of Greece.

Santorini got its current half-moon shape around 1,650 BC after
 a huge volcanic eruption. In ancient times, its shape was round and,
  in fact, a myth claims that the island emerged out of the sea in a 
  miraculous way. However, the intense volcanic eruption eliminated about 
  half of the island, covered the Minoan settlement of Akrotiri on the south of the island
   in ashes, and raised waves so high that reached the northern coasts of Crete and destroyed
    Minoan towns, including the famous Knossos Palace.

Today, half of the caldera is submerged, which makes it the only sunken caldera in the world. 
The volcano remains active and, throughout the centuries, many eruptions have occasionally occurred. 
The latest was as recently as 1956 when small volcanic islets emerged from the bottom of the caldera.
 In one of these eruptions, the islet of Nea Kameni emerged just opposite the caldera villages. 
 The volcano can be approached by boat or jet ski excursions and is a must-see in Santorini.

Another enchanting sight that Santorini displays is the architecture of the villages, built 
right on the edge of the caldera. Those picturesque villages distinguish for their sugar-cube houses,
 paved streets, wonderful churches, and, most of all, the breathtaking view of the Aegean Sea. In fact,
  the incredible architecture of the island makes it a convenient location for parkour, a new impressive sport. 
  From Oia, you will enjoy the most romantic sunset ever, with the orange sun dipping into the sea. Due to this 
  unique atmosphere, the island has become a popular wedding and, at the same time, honeymoon destination.

The beauty of Santorini has inspired many writers and artists, as well as cinema makers, 
who frequently choose the island for shooting their movies. Jules Verne had visited the 
place during one of his travels and, in fact, he mentions Santorini in his book Twenty 
thousand leagues under the sea. The island also constitutes the inspiration behind his 
novel The Mysterious Island, in which Captain Nemo and his crew witnessed a volcanic eruption.
 Greek poet George Seferis wrote a poem about Santorini in the 1960s, while the internationally-famous composer
  Yanni created a wonderful composition inspired by the island.

Many people also link the island of Santorini with the 
mythical Atlantis, although this theory is believed to be
 a myth today. Apart from walking the caldera villages, the 
 lovely beaches on the southern side of the island, including 
 Red Beach, Kamari, and Perissa, which have developed into large 
 beach resorts, are also worth a visit.

  <li><b style="color: cyan;">Great Wall of China, China</b></li>

  The one thing most people “know” about the Great Wall of China—that 
  it is one of the only man-made structures visible from space—is not 
  actually true. Since the wall looks a lot like the stone and soil that 
  surround it, it is difficult to discern with the human eye even from low Earth orbit, 
  and is difficult to make out in most orbital photos. 
  However, this does not detract from the wonder of this astounding ancient structure.

For millennia, Chinese leaders instituted wall-building
 projects to protect the land from northern, nomadic invaders. 
 One surviving section of such an ancient wall, in the Shandong
  province, is made of hard-packed soil called “rammed earth” and 
  is estimated to be 2,500 years old. For centuries during the Warring 
  States Period, before China was unified into one nation, such walls defended the borders.

Around 220 B.C.E., Qin Shi Huang, also called the First Emperor,
 united China. He masterminded the process of uniting the existing 
 walls into one. At that time, rammed earth and wood made up most of the
  wall. Emperor after emperor strengthened and extended the wall, often with
   the aim of keeping out the northern invaders. In some places, the wall was 
   constructed of brick. Elsewhere, quarried granite or even marble blocks were used.
    The wall was continuously brought up to date as building techniques advanced.

Zhu Yuanzhang, who became the Hongwu Emperor, took power in 1368 C.E. He founded
 the Ming Dynasty, famous for its achievements in the arts of ceramics and painting. 
 The Ming emperors improved the wall with watchtowers and platforms. Most of the familiar
  images of the wall show Ming-era construction in the stone. Depending on how the wall 
  is measured, it stretches somewhere between 4,000 and 5,500 kilometers (2,500 and 3,400 miles).

In the 17th century, the Manchu emperors extended 
Chinese rule into Inner Mongolia, making the wall less important as
 a defense. However, it has retained its importance as a symbol of Chinese
  identity and culture. Countless visitors view the wall every year. It may not
   be clearly visible from space, but it is considered “an absolute masterpiece” here
    on Earth.
